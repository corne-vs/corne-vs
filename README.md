- Hi, I’m @corne-vs
- I’m interested in all things software related. I'm still too much of a newb to know exactly which fields I want to end up in, however I have a particular interest in cybersecurity.
- I’m currently learning the fundamentals through CS50x. When I have completed the course I should have a better understanding of the path I want to take.
